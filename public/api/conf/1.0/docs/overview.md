The Check a UK VAT Number API lets your application:

* check if a UK VAT number is registered
* view the name and address of the related business
* get a reference number to prove you checked the UK VAT number

This API works in two modes:

1. Simple unverified check, which does not provide a reference number
2. Verified check, which provides a reference number

# About version 2
Version 2 moves the Check Your VAT Registration Number API behind authentication. You need to register to have access.

We are moving the API behind authentication so we fully understand our users.

You can still use version 1 until January 2025.


# Register for version 2
[Register for the new API using HMRCâ€™s Software Developer Hub.](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/using-the-hub)
    
Registering should take around 2 weeks. It may take longer if we need more information.
    
You will get production credentials once you have tested in the Sandbox environment and accepted the Terms of Use 2.0.
    
# When version 1 will be removed
Version 1 will be removed in January 2025.
