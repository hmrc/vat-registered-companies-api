This API enables your application to:

* check if a UK VAT number is registered
* view the name and address of the business that the UK VAT number is registered to
* get a reference number that you can use to prove you checked a UK VAT number

The Check a UK VAT Number API works in two modes:

1. Simple unverified check, which does not provide a reference number 
2. Verified check, which provides a reference number
