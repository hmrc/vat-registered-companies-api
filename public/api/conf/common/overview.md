The Check a UK VAT Number API lets your application:

* check if a UK VAT number is registered
* view the name and address of the related business
* get a reference number to prove you checked the UK VAT number

This API works in two modes:

1. Simple unverified check, which does not provide a reference number
2. Verified check, which provides a reference number
